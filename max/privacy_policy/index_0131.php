<P class="size2"><SPAN class="head">Consumer Information </SPAN><BR>
  MaxWorldwide uses one or more third party ad serving technology to serve ads at this 
  site and at our clients' sites. In the course of delivering an ad to you, the 
  third party ad serving party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your 
  browser and use information (<B>not</B> including your name, address, email 
  address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in 
  order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest

  Like most Internet sites, MaxWorldwide and its third party ad serving party uses &quot;cookies&quot;

  What are cookies and how do they enhance your Web experience? <BR>
  <BR>
  A cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the first time you are served 
  an ad. This number is stored in a file on your computer. For instance, cookies 
  help ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same ad. Cookies can also help 
  advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness 
  of an ad. This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to 
  your needs. In other words, cookies help us deliver to you the types of ads 
  in which you are more interested. <BR>
  <BR>
  Although we believe that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web (by 
  not repeatedly serving the same ads to you and delivering more relevant messages 
  to you), neither MaxWorldwide nor its third party ad serving party needs cookies to deliver 
  ads to you. <BR>
</P>

  If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that 
  allows you to deny or accept this feature. In order to &quot;opt out&quot; of
